# 🕵️ Android Spyware System

## Overview

The Android Spyware System, created by [ArnabXero](https://arnob.dev), is a comprehensive solution designed to provide remote access to data on a target Android device. This system consists of two components: an Android application that must be discreetly installed on the victim's phone and a secure web dashboard for monitoring and accessing the collected information. Additionally, we have plans to develop mobile applications for more convenient access in the near future.

## 🚀 How it Works

1. **Android Application Installation**: To begin monitoring a target device, install the Android Spyware System app on the victim's phone. During the installation process, create a user account and remember the login credentials. This account will grant you access to the web dashboard.

2. **Web Dashboard Access**: Once the app is installed and the user account is set up, use the provided login credentials to access the web dashboard. From there, you can remotely monitor and access all the data stored on the victim's device through our intuitive web application.

3. **Future Mobile Applications**: We are actively working on developing mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms, making it even more convenient for you to access the collected data on the go.

## 💻 Development Details

### Android App

The Android app is developed using Android Studio, with Java as the primary programming language. This ensures a robust and efficient application that can discreetly operate on the target device.

### Web Application & Server

Our web application and server are built using Node.js, providing a reliable and scalable backend infrastructure. The frontend is developed using React.js for a user-friendly interface, while Next.js is used for server-side rendering and project management. We utilize MongoDB as our database system and AWS S3 buckets for secure data storage services.
